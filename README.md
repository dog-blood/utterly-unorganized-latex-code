# utterly-unorganized-latex-code


latex code from my first year of engineering. 


most of this code is mine. some stuff is a hodgpotch of random solutions i found on the internet. Some of it was thrown together with chatGPT and a fuckton of tweaking



This code is some of my earlier work, and I don't think its representative of my current skill's. Nonetheless the attention it got was a big inspiration for me so thank you all!


You will have memory limit issues trying to compile, and you'll need shell escape for certain things.
